# After getting started

You're nearing the end of the course, but you're just getting started! This is an exciting journey of continuous learning, challenge and growth.

It is easy to get stuck in the 'getting started' phase \(it doesn't help that the number of 'getting started' tutorials is so much more than the 'getting good' or 'master X' tutorials\). So it's important that you deliberately practice getting good at your craft.

## Keep on learning

## Recommended reading/watching

In addition to the links that we've embedded in each chapter of this gitbook, here are some additional books/videos that we've found useful. As a rule of thumb, if you want to get good at a topic \(e.g. git\), look at the **Recommended reading** section under that topic's chapter \(see [example](https://thoughtworks-jumpstart.gitbooks.io/jumpstart/content/01_programming_fundamentals/git/basic_git_1.html)\)
