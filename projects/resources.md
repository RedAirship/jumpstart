Here are list of lists of APIs which you can get data for your front-end projects.

If you need to sign up to get an API key, remember to follow these rules when using the key:

1. Treat the key as a secret, like you would a password
2. Don't bundle the API key with the frontend code \(it can be read by any

   visitor to the site!\)

3. Keep your API keys in an `.env` file in your server code
4. Add the `.env` file to `.gitignore` to prevent it from being accidentally

   committed

5. Add the API key as a config or environment variable on the server where your app is deployed
6. Here are some collections of APIs that you might find useful
