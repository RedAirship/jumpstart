# Integration Testing 


### Learning checklist
- 

#### Steps in a typical HTTP API integration test:
- start server (it's helpful to wrap the code that does this in a function so you can reuse it in your app and in your integration test)
- in your test, make a HTTP request to the endpoint that you want to test, and make assertions on the HTTP response
- do clean up (e.g. stop server)
- see example: https://youtu.be/DdqiXcYDv-8?t=2h17m11s
