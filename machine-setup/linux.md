# Linux

## Package manager

Depending on your Linux distribution you will use a different package manager.

For Fedora based distributions (e.g. RHEL, CentOS) you will use `dnf`*.

For Debian based distributions (e.g. Ubuntu) you will use `apt`.

* `dnf` is the next-generation version of `yum`. To install `dnf` run `yum install dnf`.
