# Fetching data

Once we learn to fetch data using javascript, we can build front-end applications to present data in interesting ways!

## Learning checklist

* What `fetch` is used for
* What is [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON)
* How to use `fetch()`
* What it returns \(a promise!\)
* What are promises
  * A Promise is **an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation**. 
* How to handle outcome of the asynchronous operation
  * You can either use `.then` or `.catch`, or
  * You can `await` on promise objects
  * [contrast with old-style callbacks](../../../javascript/asynchronous-javascript/comparing-3-approaches.md)
* How to write unit test for async operations
