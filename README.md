# ThoughtWorks JumpStart!
![JumpStart](./images/Jumpstartlogo1.png)

Welcome! We're happy to have you here. The next 3 months will be a tremendous period of learning and growth, if you put in the effort. We're excited to start this journey with you.

### About ThoughtWorks
We are a community of passionate individuals whose purpose is to revolutionize software design, creation and delivery, while advocating for positive social change. Read more about us [here](https://www.thoughtworks.com/)!

### Some ground rules
To ensure that you and your classmates get the most out of JumpStart!, we will be enforcing some ground rules:
- **Attendance**. As stated in our enrolment agreemnet, our attendance policy for graduation is no more than 4 absences during the course. 15 minutes late will count as 1/3 absence. If you know you'll be late or absent, please inform us on the main slack channel.
- **Be punctual**. If we say a class will start at 1.30pm, we mean it!
- **Respect and help each other**. Everyone progresses at different paces on different topics, so when we know something well we offer to help those who are still learning it.
- **Avoid cross-talking**. Having side conversations when someone else is talking is distracting for everyone else who's trying to listen.
- **Assignment/project submission**: The only way to really learn software development is to code. The assignments and projects is targeted towards that. As such, all labs and projects must be submitted the next day.
- **Focus**. Laptops/phones and other gadgets should not be used for non-class purposes.
- **Keep our environment conducive**. Avoid funky-smelling food in a classroom and clean up after ourselves at breaks and the end of the day. Don't leave your dishes in the kitchen sink!
- **Entrance policy**. If you're the first few to arrive, please help us help your classmates (but not strangers!) enter the office.
- **Give us feedback!** After every session, put a sticky on the wall and let us know what was good and what could be improved

- **Enjoy yourselves!** This could be the best 3 months of your life :-)

### Confidentiality Agreement
- Non-JumpStarters are **not** allowed to enter ThoughtWorks premises. This will violate the confidentiality agreement which you have signed.
- Do not share any information that you overhear about ThoughtWorks' clients
- Do not take or share photos of the ThoughtWorks office (apart from those taken in your classroom) 

### How to succeed in JumpStart!
- **Do all labs and assignments, even if they are optional**. The most effective way to learn is to learn by doing. The labs and assignments are designed so that you can **code** as much as you can and apply the knowledge that you've learned in class.
- **Ask questions**. Unanswered questions -> shaky building blocks -> great difficulties in building up your knowledge. If there's anything that you're not sure about, don't hesitate to ask your instructors or classmates
- **Share knowledge**. Teaching is the best way to learn.
- **Take notes.** Several [studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51064014_Note_Taking_Review_Memory_and_Comprehension) have shown that taking notes while learning improves retention. It's a way of externalizing cognition, which is like adding RAM and HDD space to your brain!
- **Acknowledge that coding is hard**. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. 
- **Nobody is naturally good at programming**. It's something which we all initially suck at but which we can get good at with deliberate practice
- **It's ok to make mistakes**. There's a chinese saying - "failure is the mother of success". Experiment, make mistakes, see errors in your terminal, fix those errors. That's one of the most effective ways to learn.
- **Be better than yesterday**. Compare yourself with no one but yourself. As long as you're better than you were yesterday, it counts as an achievement.
