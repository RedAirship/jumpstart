<!-- TODO: flesh out relevant portions from https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/modern-javascript-explained-for-dinosaurs-f695e9747b70 -->
### Learning checklist
- what does webpack do?
  - webpack takes care of **module bundling** (a feature that is not available in ES5)
- what does babel do
  - babel converts ES6 to ES5
  - `babel-core` converts the syntax
  - `babel-preset-es2015-native-modules` converts the ES6 module system to the ES5 CommonJS module system
- `webpack.config.js`
  - where we define the configuration for how we want webpack to run
- what is compile/transpile?
- There are other module bundlers out there too (e.g. [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs))
