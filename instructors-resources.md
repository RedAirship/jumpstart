## Tips

* Use [**formative assessments**](http://swcarpentry.github.io/swc-releases/2017.02/instructor-training/02-novice/) every 15-30 minutes to help trainees consolidate theoretical knowledge by coding/practising. 
* Before the lesson, draw your lesson plan as a **concept bubble maps**. This will help us find out whether we are covering too much/too little in a single session. Some researchers have found that the human brain can only hold 7±2 things at once. If your concept bubble map has more than 7 things, it's probably a sign that the session should be broken up into multiple smaller sessions
* When teaching a new concept, start with the happy path. Get them coding and understanding the happy path, and then go into the edge cases / gotchas / pitfalls. Otherwise, students can conflate what they're learning with the potentiall confusing corner cases and conclude that everything is confusing
* Go through lesson outline together with your instructor pair before starting the session. This will help your instructor pair to know what you're going to cover, and help prevent situations where one instructor jumps in on a subtopic that the other instructor planned to cover later in the session.

## Get feedback

* Use positive and negative prompts:
  * Example “positive” prompts:  What is the most important thing you learned? What new skill are you most excited about using? 
  * Example “negative” prompts:  Write down one thing that is confusing and you’d like clarification on? What is one specific question that you have after today's lesson?

## Helper shell scripts

We've written some helper shell scripts to make life easier for instructors \(cloning and installing dependencies in 10 repos is not fun\).
