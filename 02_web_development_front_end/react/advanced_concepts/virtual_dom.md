# Virtual DOM


Internally, React has a virtual DOM and a 'diff-ing' mechanism to calculate what has changed, and React only updates whatâ€™s necessary! (See example [here](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/zKRGpo?editors=0010) - inspect Elements and observe that only the h2 tag in the DOM is changing)
