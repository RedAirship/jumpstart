# Data Structures and Algorithms

Good data structures make the code very easy to design and maintain, whereas the best code can't make up for poor data structures.

From Linus Torvalds, creator of Linux and Git:

> git actually has a simple design, with stable and reasonably well-documented data structures. In fact, I'm a huge proponent of designing your code around the data, rather than the other way around, and I think it's one of the reasons git has been fairly successful \[â€¦\] I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important. Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships.
