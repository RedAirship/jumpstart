# Front-end apps

In this course, we'll learn how to deploy our React applications to 2 places: [now.sh](https://staticwebsite-iovxvrfinf.now.sh/) and [heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

There are many other platforms for deploying your applications. For React apps, the create-react-app README page has a great [write-up](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#deployment) on other ways to deploy your react applications.
