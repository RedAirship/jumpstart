# React

### What is React?

React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows you to create front-end applications through the creation of reusable, decoupled and testable components.

* [http://facebook.github.io/react-native/showcase.html](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/showcase.html) \(React Native also uses the same syntax and patterns as React for building mobile applications\)
* [https://facebook.github.io/react-vr/](https://facebook.github.io/react-vr/) \(React VR also uses the same syntax and patterns as React for building VR applications!\)

### Why can't I do it without React?

### How do I get good at React?

When working with React, you will undoubtedly face new and scary jargon. An important way to learn and be effective with React is to:

* understand its building blocks \(e.g. JSX, components, `props`, `state`, etc\)
* build on what you have learnt about Javascript \(functions, classes, ES6 syntax, static methods, modules, etc.\)
* build applications with React. 

## Resources

* [Official React Getting Started Guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html) \(Recommendation: Work through tutorial up through till 'Thinking in React'\)
* [React sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/) and [Stack Blitz](https://stackblitz.com/) are useful for trying out React snippets.
