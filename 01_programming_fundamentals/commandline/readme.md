# Unix commandline

As programmers, the Unix command line (a.k.a. terminal / bash shell / zsh shell) is one of the most important tools in your toolkit. It is important to learn some basic ways working with the command line. It can take several months and years to truly master it, but a few days and weeks of effort in learning this tool will make you a more effective programmer.
