# Test Pyramid

## Learning checklist

* **Unit Testing** - validate that each unit of the software performs as expected
* **Integration Testing** - ensure that the units work good together
* **User Interface Testing \(End-to-end Testing\)** - test the application interfaces from the user's perspective
* **Regression Testing** - verify that a previously developed and tested software hasn't regressed. \(Snapshot testing is a kind of regression testing\)
* **Manual testing** - verify by hand that the software works/looks as you expect. This is time-consuming, non-repeatable and unscalable type of testing, and should be the least in proportion to the other types of tests
