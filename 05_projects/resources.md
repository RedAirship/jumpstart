# Useful APIs

Here are list of lists of APIs which you can get data for your front-end projects. For most APIs, you probably need to sign up to get an API key (remember to (i) keep your API key(s) in a `.env` file, (ii)  add `.env` to `.gitignore`, (iii) add the api key as a config/environment variable in wherever you're deploying your app to)
