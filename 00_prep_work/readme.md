# Prep work

Here is a list of resources for you to pick up basic programming skills before day-one of the course.

Since your time during the course is precious, we would not spend much time on the basics. It's **important** that you **complete** the preparatory work listed below before day-one.

Task List
- Improve your typing speed
- Get familiar with syntax and core API of Javascript
- Get familiar with basic elements of HTML and CSS

## Typing Tutor

If you work as a software developer, you will spend a lot of your time with a keyboard. One of the secrets for a productive developer is to type fast, really fast.

If you are interested in improving your typing speed, try a few tutorials here:

## Javascript

If you are totally new to Javascript, here is an online course for beginners.
- [Codecademy - Javascript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)

The [tutorial on Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) is pretty good too.

If you are keen to pick up a book, here is a good one:
- [Learn Enough Javascript to Be Dangerous](https://www.learnenough.com/javascript-tutorial)

From time to time, you may need to refer to the core concepts/APIs in Javascript. Here are some good references for you:
- [Dev Docs](http://devdocs.io/javascript/)

## HTML/CSS

Follow this tutorial to pick up the basics on HTML and CSS:
- [FreeCodeCamp - HTML/CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/say-hello-to-html-elements)

The website is a bit hard to navigate. You need to scroll the text on the left hand side to the bottom. Then you can see buttons like "Run Test", "Save your progress", etc.

## Text Editors

During the course, we will set up [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as our editor. If you're having trouble setting it up on your own, you can use the following online code editors:
- https://repl.it/ (for javascript)
- https://codepen.io (for HTML, CSS, Javascript)
