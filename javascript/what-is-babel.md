# Babel

## What is Babel

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) is a transpiler that convert cutting edge/experimental/exotic JavaScript syntax into the ES5 syntax that the JavaScript engines in browser/node environment can execute.

## Why do we need Babel

Use cases

- Transpile ES6 syntax into ES5 syntax
- Transpile JSX syntax (the one used by React) into pure JavaScript

## How to use Babel

You need to configure in your project root directory, using `babel.config.js` or `.babelrc` file. More details can be found in their [official documentation](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/configuration)
