# Testing with Mocks

Mocking is a technique to isolate test subjects by replacing dependencies with objects that you can control and inspect. The goal for mocking is to replace something we donâ€™t control \(e.g. a http request which may or may not succeed\) with something we do. 

Mock and stubs enable a different style of testing. They encourage testing based on behaviour verification.

## Creating and using mock functions

### Creating a mock

* Creating a mock: `const myMockFunction = jest.fn()`
* Creating a mock with a name: `const mockFn = jest.fn().mockName('mockedFunction')`
  * You can optionally provide a name for your mock functions, which will be displayed instead of "jest.fn\(\)" in test error output. Use this if you want to be able to quickly identify the mock function reporting an error in your test output.

### Verifying that the mock function has been called

* `expect(myMockFunction).toBeCalled()`
* Checking the specific number of times that a mock function has been called: `expect(myMockFunction).toHaveBeenCallTimes(2)`

### Verifying the arguments that were supplied to the mock

* `expect(mockFunc).toBeCalledWith(arg1, arg2)`

### Stubbing a mock function's return value

* `const myMockFunction = jest.fn(() => 42)`
* `myMockFunction.mockReturnValue(42)`
  * make `myMockFunction()` return 42 everytime you call myMockFunction\(\)
* `myMockFunction.mockReturnValueOnce('you can return anything!')` 
  * make `myMockFunction()` return this value only once \(it returns `undefined` the next time it's called\)

### Resetting mocks

* Mock functions keep track of various things \(e.g. how many times it has been called\). You'll need to reset mocks beforeEach test case, so that each test case is kept independent.
* `myMockFunction.mockClear()`
* If you find yourself calling .mockClear\(\) on multiple mocks, there is a command that let you clear all mocks in one line: `jest.clearAllMocks()`

## Creating and using mock modules

### Mocking a module

* Mocking the contents of a module

```javascript
const myMockFunction = jest.fn();
jest.doMock("./someModule", () => {
  return myMockFunction; 
  // Note: what you return here should match the exports in './someModule.js'
});

// Note: it's crucial that you put this next line after jest.doMock() statements
const anotherModule = require("./anotherModule.js"); 

/*
now, inside anotherModule.js, any line that says `const x = require('./someModule')
will be replaced with whatever you return from the factory function inside
jest.doMock('./someModule', factoryFunction)
*/
```

* The exact same thing that can be done, even for external libraries that we install!

```javascript
const myMockFunction = jest.fn();
jest.doMock("mathjs", () => {
  return {
    randomInt: () => 42 // always return 42 when math.randomInt() is called
  }; 
});

// Note: it's crucial that you put this next line after jest.doMock() statements
const anotherModule = require("./anotherModule.js"); 

/*
// inside anotherModule.js:

const math = require('mathjs')
math.randomInt() // this will always return the stubbed value of 42
*/
```

## Mocks, stubs, dummies, spies, whaaaat?

**Mocks** are objects/functions that can be used to \(i\) replace actual object/functions in test cases and \(ii\) verify that objects/functions are called/used \(optionally with a specific number of calls and specific arguments\) 

**Stubs** provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what's programmed in for the test.

**Dummy** objects are passed around but never actually used. Usually they are just used to fill parameter lists. 

**Spies** are objects which are wrapped around the actual object of interest. Spies allow us to to "spy on" actual objects and record some information on how they were called \(e.g. specific number of calls and specific arguments\)
